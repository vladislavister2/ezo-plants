## Tech Stack
-Nest.js + TypeScript

Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework, which extends frameworks like Express by adding modular organization. The use of modular structure simplifies the division of the project into separate blocks. It uses TypeScript which enabless developers to add types to our variables and provides compile errors and warnings based on them.

-Postgres + Sequelize
Sequelize is an ORM that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8). Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications with multiple databases.
